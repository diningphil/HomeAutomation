# HomeAutomation
## Angular2 -- Express -- NodeJS to interact with devices and display sensor data.

### Instructions:

1. type `cd client && npm install && tsc && cd .. && npm install`

2. run `node raspiServer.js` in your device (default port is 3001)

3. adjust device's IP address in server.js to enable a connection between server and devices

4. run `node server.js` and test it in localhost:3000

Note: You find a .mdj file in the main folder --> open it with StarUML if you want to visualize a couple of diagrams showing the simple architecture of the project.

## TODO
1. Improve graphics
2. Add more features
